This repo is used for my first CI/CD pipeline for GCP Cloud Functions. You can find the original sample code here: https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/nodejs-docs-samples/tree/master/functions/helloworld. Pipeline was built according to this super helpful tutorial https://medium.freecodecamp.org/continuous-deployment-for-node-js-on-google-cloud-platform-751a035a28d5. The deployment link is https://us-central1-cicdnodejs.cloudfunctions.net/helloGET. I will keep it alive for a while (maybe 10 days?), but not forever. :) FYI, today is Dec 2, 2018.
